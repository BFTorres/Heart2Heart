      "body": "Healing doesn't happen all at once. It unfolds—step by step, across time, places, and seasons of our lives.\n\nI left Tunisia at seventeen and began building a life in Italy. I studied, worked long hours, and learned to keep going—often relying on resilience alone. For a while, that felt like enough. Until life asked for something different.\n\nMoving to Germany, and later spending time in Dubai and the Netherlands, became turning points. I started therapy and stepped into personal development training where I discovered embodiment practices—the moment I realized my body had been speaking all along. Learning to listen changed everything.\n\nFrom there I deepened my path through somatic coaching, Internal Family Systems (IFS), yoga teacher training, sound healing, and Reiki. In Nepal, during a three-day silent fasting retreat, stillness made something clear: I wanted to create a space where people can come home to themselves.\n\nHeart 2 Heart Somatics grew from this lived experience. My work is gentle, grounded, and paced to what feels safe—supporting you in stress regulation, body connection, and inner balance, in person or online.",
