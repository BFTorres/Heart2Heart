      "summary": "My healing didn't happen all at once.\n\nIt unfolded step by step, across time, places, and seasons of my life.",
      "body": "I left Tunisia at 17 and moved to Italy to study medicine. I worked and studied at the same time. For years, I lived in survival mode. I burned out more than once. I kept going anyway. Italy was a chapter of endurance, there I learned how to survive. When I finally moved to Germany, the survival stopped and  I discovered I was carrying Complex PTSD with dissociative disorder. And that's when everything I had been holding in for years began to surface. And what came up at first was emotional meltdown and later emotional breakdown ,patterns I didn't understand yet.\n\nYears later i moved to Dubai. There I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and my therapist identified me as a highly sensitive person. I started therapy, and it helped but the real turning point though came one year later in the Netherlands. That´s where, I stepped into personal development trainings and discovered embodiment practices.I still remember the first tears of joy, the first time i didn´t feel dissociated from my body.\n\nI felt alive, i felt fully present, i felt at home within. That was the moment I realized: My body had been speaking all along. I just hadn't learned how to listen yet. Learning to listen changed everything.\n\nWhat started as a journey to heal myself slowly became something more. I trained in somatic coaching in UK. I studied Internal Family Systems in Jordan. I continued with yoga, sound healing, and Reiki in Nepal. In Nepal, during a three-day silent fasting retreat in a mountain temple, something became clear in that stillness.\n\nDuring the meditation, The name came to me -Heart to Heart Somatics. I knew then that i wanted to hold space for others to come home to themselves. Today, my work is from my heart to yours. It comes from lived experience. Because I know what it means to survive. I know how to feels to come home. And I know what it takes to finally feel safe in your own body.",
